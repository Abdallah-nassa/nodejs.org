## What is this repo?

[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) by the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/) builds on the merged community's past website projects to form a self-publishing, community-managed version of the previous site.

On a technical level, inspiration has been taken from the `iojs.org` repo while design and content has been migrated from the old [nodejs.org repo](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org-archive). These technical changes have helped to facilitate community involvement and empower the foundation's internationalization communities to provide alternative website content in other languages.

This repo's issues section has become the primary home for the Website WG's coordination efforts (meeting planning, minute approval, etc).

## Contributing

There are two ways to contribute to this project. The first is **submitting new features or fixing bugs** and the second is **translating content to other languages**.

In both cases the workflow is different, please check how it is done in each case.

### To submit a new feature or a bugfix

Please contribute! There are plenty of [good first issues](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/labels/good%20first%20issue) to work on. To get started, you have to [fork](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/fork) this repo to your own GitHub account first. Then open up a terminal on your machine and enter the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your user name>/nodejs.org.git
cd nodejs.org
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:8080/en/`. This page should reload automatically when you make changes to the code, but no code is perfect, so sometimes you may need to restart it. :)

If you want to submit a new feature or a bugfix, the best way is to create the changes in a separate branch, e.g.: `git checkout -b feature/mycoolfeature`. This will make it easier for you to submit a pull request and get your feature merged.
